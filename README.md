This is my attempt to recreate the popular game 2048. I am using HTML, Javascript and CSS to make a web-based version of the game, and a mobile port may come later. 
This is purely an educational project, I do not claim any ownership or rights to the original 2048 game. 
All credit for the original game concept and design goes to Gabriele Cirulli. 
This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Gabriele Cirulli.
